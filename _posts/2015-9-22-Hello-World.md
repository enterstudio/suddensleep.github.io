Greetings blogosphere.

Within you will find my own recounting of my experiences and experiments in data science. But before we get to all that excitement, first I'll tell you a little about who I am.

<!--more-->

My name is John Gilling, and I'm from the Boston area. My passion is mathematics, my profession is teaching, and my ambition is data science. To this end, I've enrolled in the [Metis Data Science Bootcamp](http://www.thisismetis.com) for the next twelve weeks. As such, I've moved to [New York City](http://costumei.com/pictures/2013/05/Two-People-In-Statue-Of-Liberty-Costumes.jpg), a source of endless [excitement](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/07/a8/c4/07a8c4fc39e0034fd692fcfaa9eb5c3f.jpg) and [frustration](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/07/07/nyregion/06cityroom-transit/06cityroom-transit-blog480.jpg) for me. I'm making this blog so I can chart my progress from sublime ignorance to supreme knowledge. With that in mind, I don't expect to reach the latter goal anytime too soon, so stay tuned ... forever.

By the end of the week, I should have a new post about my first project, an analysis of the New York City MTA turnstile data. I look forward to seeing you there!
